# AI-MapClustering
Application for real-time, on-device clustering of GPS location data using AI/ML techniques. 
It visualizes dynamic clusters on a Google Map and supports smooth, responsive updates as new location data is received.

This project demonstrates how to combine:

📍 Live location tracking (via FusedLocationProviderClient)

🤖 Clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, or Google Maps Utils)

🗺️ Map-based visualization with Google Maps SDK

📱 On-device processing (no internet required)

🌟 Features

Real-time clustering of GPS points as location updates arrive

Fully offline-capable with on-device clustering logic

Support for K-Means or Google Maps Utility clustering

Custom cluster markers with color and icon styling

Zoom-level adaptive clustering (optional)

Modular and clean codebase for educational use

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Android (Kotlin/Java)

Google Maps SDK

Google Maps Android Utility Library (for marker clustering)

FusedLocationProviderClient (for live GPS)

Optional: TensorFlow Lite or Smile for custom clustering logic

📚 Use Cases

Real-time asset tracking

Crowdsourced movement mapping

Geo-fencing & area heatmaps

Mobile AI demos for clustering algorithms
